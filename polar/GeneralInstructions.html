                    In this study there are TWO types of participants: Participants A whose decisions may affect the
                    payoffs of others and of themselves and Participants B, who do not make any decisions that can
                    affect payoffs of others or their own.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Each participant A is matched in a pair with a randomly chosen Participant B.

                    In this study you will have to make a decision that will affect your payoff and the payoff of a
                    Participant B matched with you.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    You will not be told who you are matched with during or after the study, and the participant you
                    will be paired with will not be told who you are â€“ neither during or after the study.

                    Upon the completion of the study your bonus and the bonus of the Participant B will be defined by
                    your decision. We will explain what kind of decision you will have to take on the following page.
